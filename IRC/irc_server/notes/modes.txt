/Examples:

	Use of channel Modes:
MODE #Finnish +v Wiz            ; Allow WiZ to speak on #Finnish.

MODE #Fins -s                   ; Removes 'secret' flag from channel
                                #Fins.

MODE #42 +k oulu                ; Set the channel key to "oulu".

MODE #eu-opers +l 10            ; Set the limit for the number of users
                                on channel to 10.

MODE &oulu +b                   ; list ban masks set for channel.

MODE &oulu +b *!*@*             ; prevent all users from joining.

MODE &oulu +b *!*@*.edu         ; prevent any user from a hostname
                                matching *.edu from joining.

        Use of user Modes:

:MODE WiZ -w                    ; turns reception of WALLOPS messages
                                off for WiZ.

:Angel MODE Angel +i            ; Message from Angel to make themselves
                                invisible.

MODE WiZ -o                     ; WiZ 'deopping' (removing operator
                                status).  The plain reverse of this
                                command ("MODE WiZ +o") must not be
                                allowed from users since would bypass
                                the OPER command.
